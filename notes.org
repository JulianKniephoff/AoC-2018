* Notes on D
** Day 01
*** Some things I expected to work that didn't:
**** Why can I pass ~to!int~ as function, but not ~parse!int~?
**** There is no standard set type?!
*** Googleability is abysmal
**** There are few resources to begin with
**** And trying to find them often leads to many irrelevant results
***** Many C/C++ results for example
**** Also I don't like forums, which seem to be the most abundant resources I came across, yet
*** I tried using ~std.containers~ to collect in order to use ~cycle~ but it failed due to template ambiguities I didn't understand
** Day 02
*** This time, some factors coerced me into writing a more procedural solution
**** Lack of functional combinators, like for functions on pairs
***** I guess D is not a functional language, at heart
**** Template error messages, again xP
** Day 03
*** More things I didn't expect:
**** You can have local ~struct~-s, but you can't pass them to templates like ~to~
I got the message
#+begin_src
/usr/include/dlang/dmd/std/conv.d(678): Error: cannot access frame pointer of overlap.main.Rect
#+end_src
when I tried.
