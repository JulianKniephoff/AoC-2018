* Notes on D
** Day 01
*** Some things I expected to work that didn't:
**** Why can I pass ~to!int~ as function, but not ~parse!int~?
**** There is no standard set type?!
*** Googleability is abysmal
**** There are few resources to begin with
**** And trying to find them often leads to many irrelevant results
***** Many C/C++ results for example
**** Also I don't like forums, which seem to be the most abundant resources I came across, yet
*** I tried using ~std.containers~ to collect in order to use ~cycle~ but it failed due to template ambiguities I didn't understand
