Running the solutions
---------------------

You will need a D compiler.
In Arch Linux,
you can install the package group `dlang-dmd`,
which will give you the `dmd` binary.

All solutions are written
to be run like this:

```
cat input.txt | dmd -run solution.d
```

This should print the correct answer on the console.
